## Hi there 👋

I'm Levin 🥔 — a software engineer based in the Philippines.

I do full-stack things:  
AngularJS, .NET / C#, SCSS, MSSQL… and whatever the project needs.

UI design isn’t my strongest skill,  
but I *do* know when something looks wrong (most of the time).

I wouldn’t say I’ve mastered most of these tools,  
but I’m familiar with them and know how to get things done.

Some projects are private due to confidentiality.  
Most public ones are… works in progress. 🚧
